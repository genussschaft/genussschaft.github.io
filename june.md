Hallo!



I am June (she/her), a 23 year old Spanish student that is looking for a new place here in ZÃ¼rich so I can finish my masters in Computational Biology at the ETH. I am looking for somewhere to stay starting February, and your advertisement is the perfect match for me!



I consider myself very friendly and welcoming and cannot wait to get there to meet you! I love cooking (I'm vegan too, but suck at baking, sorry) and sharing drinks, but I also really enjoy sports (basketball mainly, yet I'm also known for my non-existent dance skills), playing board games (I'm terrible but it's funny to see me frustrated) and watching good movies; but especially getting to know new places by going for nice walks and swims.



I have lived in dorms and shared apartments for the last 5 years (by now I have mastered the art of cleaning dishes) and, honestly, living in a community for so long has made me who I am nowadays and I would love to keep that up; always respecting each others' time and space, especially at times of high workload. What about you?



Let me know if you are interested! We can have a chat if you wish! My e-mail is june [dot] monge [at] gmail [dot] com or you can Whatsapp me at +34 688 811 166



Best,

June
