Hi Peter!

I saw your advertisement on wgzimmer for the room in Genossenschaftsstrass, is it still available?

My name is Francesco, I’m 24 and I’m a master’s student in advanced biotechnology at the University of Pavia, in Italy.

I’m about to move to Zurich to start a traineeship (that’ll probably become a Ph.D.) in cancer biology at UZH and I’m currently looking for an accommodation starting from the end of September/start of October.

I’ve been living in Rome with 6 other flatmates for 9 months and prior to that I lived with my girlfriend in the north of Italy for 5 years, so I’m pretty accustomed to living with other people and adapting to new living situations.

I get along with virtually anyone and I'm always keen on meeting new people!

I’m clean and organized and I can take care of basic house maintenance and when I have some free time I like to spend some time chilling with my flatmates, maybe at dinner or with a beer.

I consider myself an open-minded, friendly and houmorous person and I like to travel, spend some time outdoors, cinema and good food; I enjoy these even more when in good company!

I also enjoy gardening and I have a quite good green thumb ;)

I’m free to visit whenever it’s more convenient to you (but I’ll need a couple days of notice).

If you think we’re compatible I’ll be very happy to hear from you, and if you have any question please just write me!

Greetings

Francesco

Dear Genuss, thank you for the opportunity to tell you a bit more about myself.
As I told you in a previous e-mail, I lived in Rome for 9 months. Rome is a really big city, and when I first moved there my flatmates were the only friendly faces in a city that was completely unkown to me.

Although I got along really well with my flatmates during the first months, after a while I would have been glad to do something other than the typical "dinner together with one or two beers", but they were not really interested in other activities and kind of lazy.
At that point it was quite obvious to me that while I was looking for friends, they were fine with being just flatmates.
As a young adult it can be difficult to find a friend among the colleagues, so I'd like to live with people that can be more than flatmates: friends and comrades.

People with who I can talk about life in front of a beer but also party when we feel like it, while at the same time being sensitive enough to understand that anyone can have a bad day and want to be left alone, and to respect that feeling.

I sincerely think and hope that I will be able to contribute to your community in different ways, maybe by sharing with you my music culture and bringing to the house a bit of the Italian lifestyle (along  with tasty local products) but also by being there to support you at the end of a difficult day. I hope this brief message has been enaugh to let you discover something more about myself, but if you're curious and want to know more... ask away!
Cheers

Francesco
