Dear All,

My name is Emily (33), I am Brazilian, living in ZÃ¼rich for a total of 6 years now. I have seen the advertisement for the room available in your WG that Oliver posted. I contacted him and he asked me to write you a little bit about myself.  

Professionally, I am a conservation biologist and environmental scientist. Currently I'm doing my PhD at Agroscope with the topic of sustainable agriculture. My career goal is to continue based in Switzerland, but have projects in developing countries with smallholders farmers.

Personally, I'm crazy about dancing, very energetic, but also very calm. I love talking about self development, well, to be honest, I love chatting in general (but need my isolation moments as well). I feel that I have changed a lot since coming from Brazil, and ZÃ¼rich has given  me many opportunities to develop my interests. For example, I realized love getting people together, organizing events, workshops and so on...

Regarding community living, I also realized it is something I find very important, not only for mental growth and health, but also to promote conservation. I am currently living in a really nice flat, with a lovely flatmate, but I felt that I could step up my game regarding how sustainably I'm living, and that's why I'm interested in experiencing mehr als wohnen. I have friends living in the Hunziker Areal and I really like the atmosphere, the people, and the opportunities to participate in cultural events, discussions and fair trade cooperatives. Just to keep you informed, I will also visit another room available in another WG, but I'd be delighted to come over for a chat and see how we feel with each other ðŸ™‚

Looking forward to hearing from you!
Emily
